I agree with the author that the Internet is very dangerous for children. As for me, I would not buy them my own phone and Internet access for my young children,
because I think that this has a bad effect on their vision and also on their development. In my childhood, I had neither a phone nor a computer and I entertained
myself when I was bored. I went out for a walk and came up with different games to keep myself busy so that it would not be boring.  
Coming up with games, I developed.  My childhood was very funny and I remember it.
