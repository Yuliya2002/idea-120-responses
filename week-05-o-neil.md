O'Neil organizes his presentation and criticism around the concept of
"weapons of mathematical destruction" or WMD. According to O'Neil,
WMD are mathematical models that have three characteristics: opacity, scale,
and damage. An opaque model is a model that is invisible. Although people may
sometimes know that a mathematical model determines how they are treated, they
cannot tell how it works. As an example of opacity, O'Neil looked at how
machine learning systems divide us into "behavioral tribes." He also explains
that these systems sort us based on the data they receive about our behavior,
such as our web browsing and location history, which are tracked and
reported by our mobile phones. Our tribal affiliation can dictate what
advertisements, entertainment and news are shown to us, or it can even
affect our premiums. The novelty here is that these so-called tribes
might not correspond to any groups that we humans would recognize, but
instead arise from patterns discovered by computers through data mining.
The scale of the model simply shows how widespread its influence is.
A model that affects people's lives several times a day is on a larger scale
than a model that affects several hundred people several times a year.
O'Neil cites the example that models scale so widely that they change widely
held cultural norms and values. In a fascinating discussion, she shows how
college rankings in the US News have changed not only the criteria by which
colleges are ranked, but also the institutional goals of many US colleges.
A destructive model is a model that works against the interests of the people
it affects. O'Neil sometimes equates harm with injustice, but the types of
harm she describes are varied. There are as many types of damage as there are
ways to infringe on people's interests. O'Neil gives an example of damage that
usually happens by accident. For example, usually well-intentioned, albeit
opaque and ill-conceived, value-added teacher assessment models have caused
good teachers to be fired or expelled from school districts that need them,
leaving already poor students at an even greater disadvantage.
