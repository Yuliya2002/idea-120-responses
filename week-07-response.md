I agree with the author that the Internet is very dangerous for children. As for me, I would not buy them my own phone and Internet access for my young children,
because I think that this has a bad effect on their vision and also on their development. In my childhood, I had neither a phone nor a computer and I entertained
myself when I was bored. I went out for a walk and came up with different games to keep myself busy so that it would not be boring.  
Coming up with games, I developed.  My childhood was very funny and I remember it. Sometimes I also think that YouTube for children is a little strange because people show cartoons to children that have no meaning and do not teach anything, but children are very dependent on them and thousands of children watch these cartoons.
