Most games are written using special code based on the C programming language. Coding is used for all polygons, shadows and textures 
that the user sees on the screen. Another important aspect of the code is the artificial intelligence component.Through coding in the 
game, we can see animations and games, objects and characters that interact with each other.If more people play video games, they can improve basic visual
processes. As well as improving life skills.As far as I know, many companies now think that if employees play video games during breaks during working hours, 
then they will work more efficiently. One such company is Walmart. "One of the goals we wanted to accomplish with gamification training was to give our 
associates the space to learn so that if they make a mistake, it doesn't impact customers," said Michelle Malashock, a Walmart corporate communications 
spokesperson. This helps store staff to resolve issues on the spot, as employees have already practiced such situational modeling in games. It also helps to 
sell a large number of games, since the employees themselves played these games.
