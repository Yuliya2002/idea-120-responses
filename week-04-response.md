I think that food photography or images in Instagram that would be read differently because people who sign into
Instagram they want to see just beutiful picture of food and it shouldn't be advertising. Barthes explains the
three masseges of images on his article. First message is linguistic as I said before in Instagram people couldn't
do the advertising of food because of the terms and rigts this appp.   The second message is the literal image.
This message yields a series of discontinuous signs. The first sign is the freshness of the products and that of
the domestic preparation. As I said before Instagram images should be beutiful because people wouldn't like the
post. The second sign is the red, green, and yellow color of Italy. Posts on Instagram should be a combination of
colors so that some part is not caught in the eye. The fourth sign is the composition of the image conveys an
aesthetic signified, namely, the still life. On Instagram, people don't care how the food was prepared and whether
it was difficult to prepare it because people need the beauty of this food. The fourth sign is the composition of
the image conveys an aesthetic signified, namely, the still life. On Instagram, people who post, or rather photos
of food, so that other people like it and so that the food looks beautiful in this image. The third message is the
Symbolic Image. The symbolic message is in fact the second "iconic" messages.
