Murray says American television is moving towards the digital high definition standard. He also claims that in the
future we will be able to point and click on different branches of the same TV program as easily as using the
remote control to switch from one channel to another. I think that part of what he said is already starting to
come true, or rather, we can now connect a computer to a TV to get into virtual reality or an environment
using 3D glasses. I would not be surprised if in the future it will be possible to watch a movie in virtual
reality where you will be the main character of this movie. Since Murray explains what the audience will feel
or see, I can say that all the actors who say it will be on the same track, while the actors' personal thoughts
will only be visible to one viewer. The film can hide the motives of the main characters from each other, as the
audience can choose which character to approach
