Tressy Cottom O'Neill believes that commercial organizations aggressively target poor people. They promote “advertisements that point to people who are in dire 
need and sell false or overpriced promises. Find inequality and enjoy it. " They work with Cottom's “education gospel,” this widespread belief in the fruitful 
link between education and career development. In terms of online advertising in general, O'Neill notes that Facebook and Google ads are interesting weapons of
mass destruction because they do have some unusual quirks, one of which is derived from campaigns. He argues that humans are vigorously learning from new data and 
are now "self-analyzing the data using machine learning." They also operate on a very large scale, further enhancing their learning ability. O'Neill also believes
that there is another industry that uses predatory advertising: payday loans.
